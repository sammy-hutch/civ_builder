## Additional Components & Ideas
Defined starting civilisations â€“ each player has a defined civilisation, which offers an in-game effect, end-game scoring bonus and unique starting cards. This encourages players to play to a particular style.

Civ ideas:
- Worker swarm civ: promotes buying lots of cheap cards and bloating deck for more VP
- Raider civ: gains benefits (such as research, stealing) from warfare
- Upgrade civ: expensive cards to research but they provide various good upgrades
- Mystic civ: can punish itself (trade cards for worse cards, destroy buildings) for greater benefits and disruptions against opponents

Additional mechanics? Maybe events which happen each round or are drawn in the trade rows. The pace and end of the game can be determined by these events, rather than by exhausting landmark deck

A pile of set aside cards for each player which they can spend research value on to unlock these cards and add them to their discard instead of using research to draw cards. This could tie into the unique starting civs

## Feedback
- jonny: shuffle heroes into civilian deck.
- jonny: one new monument per round, max of 5 in row at a time so excess is trashed
- sam: double money working well, double steal working well, warfare weak
- justas: stealing is heavy with having to look through three different discards
- justas: when destroying a building with warfare, you could get to use the action of that building
- sam: warfare could give you the building you destroy. that way, encouraged to take warfare to get other's buildings. would discourage building monuments, so maybe those are safe? but then they need less strength
- sam: warfare could be enouraged and steal reduced
- jens: extend trade rows to 5 cards
- jens: high cognitive load looking at so many trade rows
- justace: splendor style vp
- jonny: each get a few monuments with unique abilities to start with, then buy pure static vp monuments from a pile rather than a row

## To Do
- adjust costs: make all cards cheaper (currently trialing with half-cost cards)
- assess impact of starting with a landmark
- simplify cards: fewer cards with many different effects. fewer cards in general. less complexity, less dupes
- how to encourage player interaction (warfare) in 3+ player games so that there is benefit for the attacker (warfare needs to be more closely tied to steal?)
- pacing: test drawing a new hero each round
- pacing: test drawing a new landmark each round
